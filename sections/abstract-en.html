<h2>Abstract</h2>
    <span class="markdown">The File Ontology for Geometry formats (FOG) provides meaningful relations between things (e.g. building objects) and their geometry descriptions. These geometry descriptions can be (1) RDF-based (e.g. using specific ontologies such as GEOM, OntoBREP, etc.), (2) RDF literals containing embedded geometry of existing geometry formats and (3) RDF literals containing a reference to an external geometry file. The FOG ontology extends the Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) and consists of two taxonomies of properties, one for RDF-based geometry formats with as root object property the [omg:hasComplexGeometryDescription](https://w3id.org/omg#hasComplexGeometryDescription) and one for existing geometry formats that can be represented using RDF literals with as root datatype property [omg:hasSimpleGeometryDescription](https://w3id.org/omg#hasSimpleGeometryDescription). This series of properties (e.g. [fog:asGltf](https://w3id.org/fog#asGltf)) is then splitted per version of the geometry format (e.g. [fog:asGltf_v2.0](https://w3id.org/fog#asGltf_v2.0)), which are again splitted further if the geometry format consists of different kind of files (e.g. [fog:asGltf_v2.0-glb](https://w3id.org/fog#asGltf_v2.0-glb)).</span>
