## Contributing to FOG

The FOG ontology is incomplete by nature, as it's impossible to contain all existing geometry formats. If you notice that some geometry formats are missing and you need them for your project, you can either create an issue in this repository, or you can submit a pull request.

## sparql-visualizer demo

An [online sparql-visualizer demo](https://madsholten.github.io/sparql-visualizer/?file=https:%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fbch9flrxoskw29v%2Ffog-demo.json) is available, containing sample Abox triples and example queries. The RDF literals in the Abox triples are shortend so it is more easily to visualize it as a graph. The same Abox triples with the full RDF literals are available in this repository in `examples/sample_abox_full.ttl`
